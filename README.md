## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Optional: API keys for OpenAI and/or Anthropic (for enhanced research capabilities)
- Optional: Ollama installation for local AI processing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpectralTheorem/ai-document-reader.git
   cd ai-document-reader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure AI providers** (optional)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys:
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   # OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
   ```

4. **Update model configuration** (optional)
   Edit `config.yaml` to add or modify available AI models for each provider.

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Main application: http://localhost:3005
   - Debug console: http://localhost:3005/debug

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Reading
1. Upload an EPUB file using the drag-and-drop interface
2. Navigate chapters using the sidebar
3. Read with professional typography and formatting

### AI-Powered Analysis
1. **Set up AI provider**: Go to Settings and configure your preferred AI provider
2. **For Multi-Agent Research**: Use Anthropic provider with valid API key
3. **Ask questions**: Click on any chapter to start AI-powered discussions
4. **Deep Analysis**: Multi-agent system automatically provides comprehensive research for complex queries

### Multi-Agent Research System
When using Anthropic with a valid API key:
- **Factual Questions**: "What evidence does the book provide for climate change?" ‚Üí Multiple agents gather evidence, verify claims, and provide context
- **Analytical Questions**: "How does the author's argument develop across chapters?" ‚Üí Agents analyze structure, cross-reference content, and identify patterns
- **Comparative Questions**: "How do these concepts relate to each other?" ‚Üí Agents find connections and analyze relationships
- **Evaluative Questions**: "How well-supported is this claim?" ‚Üí Agents verify evidence and assess argument strength

### Debug Console
Access `/debug` to:
- Monitor real-time agent execution
- Inspect individual agent outputs before synthesis
- View performance metrics and timing data
- Debug and iterate on agent behavior

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
- **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**: BookResearchOrchestrator coordinates parallel agent execution
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific research focus and expertise
- **Intelligent Routing**: Query analysis determines optimal agent combinations
- **Synthesis Engine**: Combines individual agent findings into coherent responses

### Configuration Management
- **Centralized Config**: Single `config.yaml` file manages all models and providers
